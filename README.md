### Minesweeper, but with a twist

Your goal in Mars-Sweeper is not to avoid the tiles warned by empty ones, but to click them.
You have limited clicks and clicking on a water tile will give you more, however, any other tile will decrease your click count
and therefore your poor little plant's lifespan :(

Be warned, the number on empty tiles can be influenced by junk tiles that won't help you at all.
~~You will be able to find out which are water or junk though, sometimes clicking on an empty tile will give you a blue counter
which **only** counts water and will help you decipher which tiles you should and shouldn't click.~~
