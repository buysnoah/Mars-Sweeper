Your goal in Mars-Sweeper is not to avoid the tiles warned by empty ones, but to click them.
You have limited clicks and clicking on a water tile will give you more, however, any other tile will decrease your click count.
Once you have found all of the ice on the map you win and I will personally congratulate you and send you 500 ancient coins

Be warned, the number on empty tiles can be influenced by junk tiles that won't help you at all.
